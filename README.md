Welcome to my simple restaurant app.

Made mobile-first and best used mobile-only...

The main navigation will allow you to traverse the 3 distinct paths of the application:

-Menu-
The Menu page allows the user to enter in an item as well as a price to create a custom menu.

-Tables-
The Tables page shows the current tables and allows for management of new tables.

-Orders-
The Orders page lists the current orders and gives a link back to past orders.
------------------------------------------------------

-Menu-
On the Menu page, the user can add a food item to the menu using the 'Add a food item to the menu' button. This will take the user to a form where they can enter the (unique) name and (non-negative) price of the dish and then add it to the menu.

Once added to the menu, the items will be listed on the initial Menu page. From here the user can click into the menu item to see which tables have ordered this item and they can delete the item off the menu. Or they can click edit to change the name and/or price of the menu item.

-Tables-
On the Table page, the user can add a table using the 'Add a new table.' button. This will take the user to a form asking for a Table Number and a (non-negative) number of guests.

Once a table is added, it will show up on the initial screen where they can be accessed directly to be interacted with or deleted. Or the table can be edited to change the table number or number of guests.

When accessed directly, the ordering screen will appear allowing the user to input the tables order by way of checkboxes. When the order is submitted, they are added to a list under 'Orders:' on the page. When it comes time to pay, the user can click the pay button which will check the table out and display a receipt with a choice to download it.

-Orders-
On the Orders page the user is able to see a list of currently active orders (*not paid for yet) or see a list of all old orders.

For current orders, a menu item can be deleted from the order or they can access the 'No Charge' button to comp an item. The order can also be paid for via this menu.
------------------------------------------------------

And that's it for now. I'd like to work on custom checkboxes to make it more mobile-friendly as well as change the order display system to handle duplicates in a more cleanly manner.
